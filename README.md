# Odds-Tracker
Horse racing odds tracker using selenium and pandas to scrap data from oddschecker and compare at 2 different time intervals

You will be required to change the link to the race you'd like to get updates for, currently it is set to the last race I used when creating the program.

This also does not work with antepost markets, you will need to figure what columns you compare in order for it to work for those.
